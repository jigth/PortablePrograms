# PortablePrograms

Portable Programs compiled from source for different platforms with specific configuration flags (in some cases). 

Destination platforms could be Ubuntu and Ubuntu based distros, Windows, MacOS, etc. In general the destination platforms will depend on the requirements of the solutions that I'm working on at a given moment.
